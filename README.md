## Changing `/etc/apt/sources.list` in Debian to use Kali pkg source
Enabling the **kali-rolling** branch is done with the command:
```
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
```

Enabling the **kali-last-snapshot** branch is done with the command:
```
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-last-snapshot main contrib non-free
```

Error: 
```bash
W: GPG error: http://kali.download/kali kali-rolling InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY ED444FF07D8D0BF6
E: The repository 'http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling InRelease' is not signed.

```bash
gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key  ED444FF07D8D0BF6
gpg -a --export ED444FF07D8D0BF6 | sudo apt-key add -

You need to run: 
```bash
gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key  ED444FF07D8D0BF6
sudo gpg -a --export ED444FF07D8D0BF6 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
```
OR you can use Ubuntu keys: 
```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 7D8D0BF6
sudo gpg -a --export 7D8D0BF6 | apt-key add -
apt update
```

## Activate the SSH
Verify that the `~/.ssh/` dir has the right permission level: 
```bash
stat -c %a ~/.ssh/
```
It should have the value: **700**

Make sure your key access (permission): 
```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_*
```
